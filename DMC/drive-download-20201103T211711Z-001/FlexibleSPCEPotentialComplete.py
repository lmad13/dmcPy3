#potential energy function for 1 flexible water. The bond lenghts and bond angle of water is not fixed
#Based on Wu, Tepper, and Voth's paper: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2136877
#and then re-parameterized by Paesani, et. al: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2386157

#A note about mass:
#in your diffusion function the diffusion depends on the mass of the atom.
#that mass array might look like:
#[massO, massH, massH]=np.array([15.99491461957,1.007825, 1.007825])/(6.02213670000e23*9.10938970000e-28)
